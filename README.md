PalindromeDetection
===================

Write a function that determines if a given string is a palindrome. A 
palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards 
or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha". 

For this question, ignore all non-alphanumerical characters and assume 
that upper and lower case characters are identical,
the function should output wheter or not the string is a palindrome and return boolean
